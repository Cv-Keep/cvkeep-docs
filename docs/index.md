# Cv Keep

Welcome to CV Keep official technical documentation. CV Keep is a **Free and Open Source Platform** intended to hold **Online Resumés**. It's completely free, pretty and simple. You can use the self-hosted version, or clone the entire project and use for your own purposes - including comercial ones - without any kind of charge or legal implications. If you intend to have an online resumé hosted by CV Keep, just go to https://cvkeep.com and create your account. 

If you want to host your own platform for any reason, keep reading this documentation. The plaform is entirely responsive, already internationalized (pt/en) with support to easily add new languages, SPA/PWA ready which means its very easy to derivate a cellphone app, and much more. Cv Keep is originally created by [Felippe Regazio](http://cvkeep.com/felipperegazio) and self-hosted on Heroku.
